# 6. Conclusion

We introduced attention-head binding (EB\*) as a mechanistic interpretability metric for tracking concept emergence in language models. Applying this metric longitudinally across the Pythia model suite (160M, 1B, 2.8B) with eight training checkpoints each, we established four empirical findings:

First, attention binding temporally precedes behavioral competence during training, serving as an early internal marker of concept acquisition (C1). Second, models with high binding but low behavioral performance contain latent knowledge that few-shot prompting can unlock on generation tasks (C3; up to +61 percentage points improvement, 183% relative gain). Third, at the 1B scale, binding and behavior decouple—binding saturates early while behavioral performance continues improving through alternative computational pathways (C4). Fourth, targeted ablation reveals that high-binding heads are necessary for task performance at 160M but *functionally superseded* at 2.8B, providing mechanistic evidence that binding's functional role undergoes qualitative transformation across scales (C5).

The binding-behavior decoupling effect is our central contribution: C4 identifies the phenomenon observationally, while C5 validates it causally. It demonstrates that the relationship between internal mechanistic structure and external behavioral capability is not fixed but scale-dependent—a finding with implications for how we interpret, monitor, and develop language models. A model's internal representations may be more complex, and more conflicted, than behavioral evaluations alone can reveal.

Attention binding offers a simple, computationally tractable diagnostic that can be extracted from any transformer model with attention access. We hope this metric proves useful both as an analytical tool for understanding concept emergence and as a practical monitoring signal for model development—particularly in safety-critical domains such as web accessibility, where the integrity of internal representations directly affects the quality of AI systems serving users with disabilities.
